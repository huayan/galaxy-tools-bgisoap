**What it does**

SOAPdenovo is a novel short-read assembly method that can build a de novo draft assembly for the human-sized genomes.
The program is specially designed to assemble Illumina GA short reads. It creates new opportunities for building
reference sequences and carrying out accurate analyses of unexplored genomes in a cost effective way.

**System requirements**

SOAPdenovo2 is designed for assembling large plant and animal genomes, although it also works well on bacteria and
fungal genomes. The code runs on 64-bit/32-bit Linux/MAC OSX systems with a minimum of 5G physical memory. Approximately
150 GB of memory is required to process large genomes such as those of humans.


**Notes**

This Galaxy tool is a wrapping of SOAPdenovo version 2.04. This version supports large k-mers of up to 127 in size to process
long reads. Changes which have been made to SOAPdenovo-1 include:

1. Merging of the 63mer and 127mer versions.

2. A new module named "sparse-pregraph" has been written which can reduce considerable computational consumption.

3. The "Multi-kmer" method has been introduced in the "contig" step to allow the utilization of the advantages of small and large kmers.

4. The scaffolding algorithm has been improved to obtain longer and more accurate scaffolds.

5. Asynchronous Input/Output (AIO) has been introduced to boost the performance of reading files.

6. Information for visualization purposes has been made available after scaffolding.

**Configuring SOAPdenovo2**

For large genome projects involving deep sequencing, data is usually organized as a series of read sequence files generated
from multiple libraries. A configuration file is required by SOAPdenovo2 to inform the assembler where to find these
files and about other relevant information required for the de novo assembly process. This configuration file is
automatically generated for SOAPdenovo2 by setting parameters on this tool page.

The configuration file has a section for global information, and is then followed by sections for each library.
Currently, only the maximum read length parameter, max_rd_len, is required in the global information section. Any reads
with lengths longer than max_rd_len will be cut to this length.

Information about the sequencing data should be organized in the corresponding library section. Each library section
starts with the tag [LIB] and includes the following items::

  avg_ins           This value indicates the average insert size of this library or
                    the peak value position in the insert size distribution.

  reverse_seq       This option takes a value that is 0 or 1 which tells the assembler if
                    the read sequences need to be complementarily reversed. Illumima GA
                    produces two types of paired-end libraries: a) forward-reverse,
                    generated from fragmented DNA ends with a typical insert size less than
                    500 bp; b) forward-forward, generated from circularizing libraries with
                    typical insert size greater than 2 Kb. The parameter "reverse_seq"
                    should be set to indicate this: 0, forward-reverse; 1, forward-forward.

  asm_flags         Setting this parameter indicates which part(s) the reads are used. It
                    takes a value of 1 for only contig assembly, 2 for only scaffold assembly,
                    3 for both contig and scaffold assembly, and 4 for only gap closure.

  rd_len_cutof      The assembler will cut reads from the current library to this length.

  rank              This sets integer values and decides the order for reads to be used for
                    scaffold assembly. Libraries with the same "rank" are used at the same
                    time during scaffold assembly.

  pair_num_cutoff   This parameter is the cutoff value for pair number for a reliable connection
                    between two contigs or pre-scaffolds. The minimum number for paired-end reads
                    and mate-pair reads is 3 and 5 respectively.

  map_len           This parameter is used in the "map" step and is the minimum alignment length
                    between a read and a contig required for a reliable read location. The minimum
                    length for paired-end reads and mate-pair reads is 32 and 35, respectively.

The assembler accepts read files in three kinds of formats: FASTA, FASTQ and BAM.

Mate-pair relationship can be indicated in two ways: two sequence files with reads in the same order belonging to a
pair, or two adjacent reads in a single file (FASTA only) belonging to a pair. If a read in a BAM file fails
platform/vendor quality checks, e.g. the flag field 0x0200 is set, itself and it's paired read will be ignored.

In the configuration file, single end files are indicated by "f=/path/filename" or "q=/pah/filename" for fasta or fastq
formats separately. Paired reads in two fasta sequence files are indicated by "f1=" and "f2=", whilst paired reads in two
fastq sequence files are indicated by "q1=" and "q2=". Paired reads in a single fasta sequence file is indicated by a
"p=" item. Reads in BAM sequence files is indicated by "b=".

All of the above items in each library section are optional since the assembler assigns default values for most of them.

**Output files**

Two files are generated by SOAPdenovo2:

1. The contig file contains sequences without mate pair information.
2. The scafSeq file contains scaffold portions of the genome which have been reconstructed from contigs and gaps.

**FAQ**

How do I set the K-mer size?

The program accepts odd numbers between 13 and 31. Larger K-mers will have a higher rate of uniqueness in the genome and
make the graph simpler, but it requires deep sequencing depth and longer read length to guarantee the overlap at
any genomic location.

How do I set the library rank?

SOAPdenovo2 will use the pair-end libraries with insert size from smaller to larger to construct scaffolds. Libraries
with the same rank would be used at the same time. For example, in a data set of a human genome, we set five ranks for
five libraries with insert size 200-bp, 500-bp, 2-Kb, 5-Kb and 10-Kb, separately. It is desired that the pairs in each
rank provide adequate physical coverage of the genome.


**Format of output files**

*Output files from pregraph*

1. kmerFreq. Each row shows the number of Kmers with a frequency equals the row number. Note that those peaks of frequencies which are the integral multiple of 63 are due to the data structure.
2. edge. Each record gives the information of an edge in the pre-graph: length, Kmers on both ends, average kmer coverage, whether it's reverse-complementarily identical and the sequence.
3. markOnEdge and path. These two files are for using reads to solve small repeats.
4. preArc. Connections between edges which are established by the read paths.
5. vertex. Kmers at the ends of edges.
6. preGraphBasic. Some basic information about the pre-graph: number of vertex, K value, number of edges, maximum read length etc.

*Output files from contig*

1. contig. Contig information: corresponding edge index, length, kmer coverage, whether it's tip and the sequence. Either a contig or its reverse complementry counterpart is included. Each reverse complementary contig index is indicated in the *.ContigIndex file.
2. Arc. Arcs coming out of each edge and their corresponding coverage by reads
3. updated.edge. Some information for each edge in graph: length, Kmers at both ends, index difference between the reverse-complementary edge and this one.
4. ContigIndex. Each record gives information about each contig in the *.contig. it's edge index, length, the index difference between its reverse-complementary counterpart and itself.

*Output files from map*

1. peGrads. Information for each clone library: insert-size, read index upper bound, rank and pair number cutoff for a reliable link. This file can be revised manually for scaffolding tuning.
2. readOnContig. Reads' locations on contigs. Here contigs are referred by their edge index. However, about half of them are not listed in the *.contig file for their reverse-complementary counterparts are included already.
3. readInGap. This file includes reads that could be located in gaps between contigs. This information will be used to close gaps in scaffolds if "-F" is set.

*Output files from scaff*

1. newContigIndex. Contigs are sorted according their length before scaffolding. Their new index are listed in this file.  This is useful if one wants to corresponds contigs in *.contig with those in *.links.
2. links. Links between contigs which are established by read pairs. New index are used.
3. scaf_gap. Contigs in gaps found by contig graph outputted by the contiging procedure. Here new index are used.
4. scaf. Contigs for each scaffold: contig index (concordant to index in *.contig),  approximate start position on scaffold, orientation, contig length, and its links to others contigs.
5. gapSeq. Gap sequences between contigs.
6. scafSeq. Sequences of each scaffolds.
7. contigPosInscaff. Contigs' positions in each scaffold.
8. bubbleInScaff. Contigs that form bubble structures in scaffolds. Every two contigs form a bubble and the contig with higher coverage will be kept in scaffold.
9. scafStatistics. Statistic information of final scaffold and contig.
