**What it does**

SOAPdenovo is a novel short-read assembly method that can build a de novo draft assembly for the human-sized genomes.
The program is specially designed to assemble Illumina GA short reads. It creates new opportunities for building
reference sequences and carrying out accurate analyses of unexplored genomes in a cost effective way.

**System requirements**

SOAPdenovo is designed for assembling large plant and animal genomes, although it also works well on bacteria and fungal
genomes. It runs on 64-bit/32-bit Linux/MAC OS systems with a minimum of 5G physical memory. For big genomes like human,
approximately 150 GB memory is required.

**Notes**

This Galaxy tool is a wrapping of SOAPdenovo 2.*. This version supports large kmers of up to 127 to utilize long reads.
Changes which have been made to SOAPdenovo include:

1. Merging of the 63mer and 127mer versions.
2. A new module named "sparse-pregraph" has been written which can reduce considerable computational comsumption.
3. The "Multi-kmer" method has been introduced in the "contig" step to allow the utilization of the advantages of small and large kmer.
4. The scaffolding algorithm has been improved to get longer and more accuracy scaffolds.
5. The Asynchronous Input/Output (AIO) was introduced to boost the performance of reading files.
6. Information for visualization purpose has beeb made available after scaffolding.

**Configuring SOAPdenovo2**

For big genome projects with deep sequencing, the data is usually organized as multiple read sequence files generated
from multiple libraries. The configuration file tells the assembler where to find these files and the relevant
information. "example.config" is an example of such a file.

The configuration file has a section for global information, and then multiple library sections. Right now only
"max_rd_len" is included in the global information section. Any read longer than max_rd_len will be cut to this length.

The library information and the information of sequencing data generated from the library should be organized in the
corresponding library section. Each library section starts with tag [LIB] and includes the following items:

1. avg_ins: This value indicates the average insert size of this library or the peak value position in the insert size distribution figure.

2. reverse_seq: This option takes value 0 or 1. It tells the assembler if the read sequences need to be complementarily reversed. Illumima GA produces two types of paired-end libraries: a) forward-reverse, generated from fragmented DNA ends with  typical insert size less than 500 bp; b) forward-forward, generated from circularizing libraries with typical insertsize greater than 2 Kb. The parameter "reverse_seq" should be set to indicate this: 0, forward-reverse; 1, forward-forward.

3. asm_flags: This indicator decides in which part(s) the reads are used. It takes value 1 (only contig assembly), 2 (only scaffold assembly), 3 (both contig and scaffold assembly), or 4 (only gap closure).

4. rd_len_cutof: The assembler will cut the reads from the current library to this length.

5. rank: It takes integer values and decides in which order the reads are used for scaffold assembly. Libraries with the same "rank" are used at the same time during scaffold assembly.

6. pair_num_cutoff: This parameter is the cutoff value of pair number for a reliable connection between two contigs or pre-scaffolds. The minimum number for paired-end reads and mate-pair reads is 3 and 5 respectively.

7. map_len: This takes effect in the "map" step and is the minimun alignment length between a read and a contig required for a reliable read location. The minimum length for paired-end reads and mate-pair reads is 32 and 35 respectively.

The assembler accepts read files in three kinds of formats: FASTA, FASTQ and BAM. Mate-pair relationship could be
indicated in two ways: two sequence files with reads in the same order belonging to a pair, or two adjacent reads in a
single file (FASTA only) belonging to a pair. If a read in bam file fails platform/vendor quality checks(the flag field
0x0200 is set), itself and it's paired read would be ignored.

In the configuration file single end files are indicated by "f=/path/filename" or "q=/pah/filename" for fasta or fastq
formats separately. Paired reads in two fasta sequence files are indicated by "f1=" and "f2=". While paired reads in two
fastq sequences files are indicated by "q1=" and "q2=". Paired reads in a single fasta sequence file is indicated by
"p=" item. Reads in bam sequence files is indicated by "b=".

All the above items in each library section are optional. The assembler assigns default values for most of them. If you
are not sure how to set a parameter, you can remove it from your configuration file.

**Output files**

Two files are outputted by SOAPdenovo2. The contig file contains sequences without mate pair information. The scafSeq
file contains scaffold portions of the genome which have been reconstructed from contigs and gaps.

**FAQ**

How do I set the K-mer size?

The program accepts odd numbers between 13 and 31. Larger K-mers would have higher rate of uniqueness in the genome and
would make the graph simpler, but it requires deep sequencing depth and longer read length to guarantee the overlap at
any genomic location.

How do I set the library rank?

SOAPdenovo will use the pair-end libraries with insert size from smaller to larger to construct scaffolds. Libraries
with the same rank would be used at the same time. For example, in a dataset of a human genome, we set five ranks for
five libraries with insert size 200-bp, 500-bp, 2-Kb, 5-Kb and 10-Kb, separately. It is desired that the pairs in each
rank provide adequate physical coverage of the genome.

**Format of output files**

*Output files from pregraph*

1. kmerFreq. Each row shows the number of Kmers with a frequency equals the row number. Note that those peaks of frequencies which are the integral multiple of 63 are due to the data structure.
2. edge. Each record gives the information of an edge in the pre-graph: length, Kmers on both ends, average kmer coverage, whether it's reverse-complementarily identical and the sequence.
3. markOnEdge and path. These two files are for using reads to solve small repeats.
4. preArc. Connections between edges which are established by the read paths.
5. vertex. Kmers at the ends of edges.
6. preGraphBasic. Some basic information about the pre-graph: number of vertex, K value, number of edges, maximum read length etc.
